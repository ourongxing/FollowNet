# pnpm
Use pnpm to install npm dependencies, and automatically determine if it is a dev dependency.

```bash
pnpm install
```

# shadcn

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to add a button component:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

Do not write components yourself, prioritize finding them in Shadcn, and use it with your style.

Do not modify `@/components/ui` directly.
